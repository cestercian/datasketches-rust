//! Relative Error Quantiles (REQ) sketch.
//!
//! Provides approximate quantile estimation with relative error guarantees, especially
//! useful for streaming scenarios needing bounded memory. Based on the paper
//! [Relative Error Streaming Quantiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01668) by Cormode,
//! Karnin, Liberty, Thaler and Veselý, and on the Apache DataSketches C++ reference
//! implementation.
